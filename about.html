			<h1>About this project</h1>
			<h2>(Written 4/21/2025)</h2>
			<p>Hello, welcome to this project page! I wanted to make this project for a couple of reasons. I am a recent graduate from University of Wisconsin Whitewater's Computer Science program who is looking to get a career in the web development and design field. As such, I wanted to make something on my own time as a portfolio piece to my early efforts.</p>
			<p>However, I have also just recently gotten into Magic: The Gathering because of some of my friends. While I'm thoroughly enjoying it so far, one of the biggest hurdles for new players in MTG is the keywords, which reduce the amount of text on cards, but are also harder to explain to people just learning the game. Because of that, I wanted to make something that would not only help me keep track of the keywords in the game, but to also allow other new players to be able to quickly search for unknown keywords, even during a match.</p>
			<p>While I consider the minimum viable product complete, I plan to continue updating this to add more deciduous keywords and features to help ease of search. Overall, this was a great project to help refamiliarize myself with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and I hope it was enjoyable for you to explore as well.</p>
